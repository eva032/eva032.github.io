As of Feb. 2, 2022, the version of aframe here is 1.2.0.

SLT

As of June 29, 2022, in addition to aframe, networked aframe,
and socketio, I have installed copies of
aframe.min.js.map
 and
socket.io.slim.js.map

because I was getting error messages in the Chrome saying it could
not find these files (error 404), so apparently it needed them.
That error is gone now.

I am (still?) getting lots of the following error message whenever
running my VR demo:

GET https://lamprocles.cs.washington.edu/socket.io/?EIO=3&transport=polling&t=O6nH89K 404 (Not Found)

So perhaps I am supposed to have socket.io  being served at its own top level folder(?).
Maybe I can do some symlinking here.
